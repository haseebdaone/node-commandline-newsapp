# Node-news

A command line application that gets the latest news using NodeJs.
You can search for news on anything you like, news related to a specific country and news pertaining to a country on a chosen category. News can be received in a language you have set (although only seems to properly work with queries) and you can change the number of results you want to display. The results also give you the url to the article if you wish to do some further reading.
